Recent studies confirm that humans respond and react to music and that
music has a high impact on person’s brain activity. The average American listens up to
four hours of music every day [2]. People tend to listen to music based on there mood
and interests. This project focuses on creating an application to suggest songs for
user based on their mood by capturing facial expressions. Facial expression is a form
of nonverbal communication. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that helps
convey a high-level understanding of digital images or videos to computers. In this
system, computer vision [18] components are used to determine the user’s emotion
through facial expressions. Once the emotion is recognized, the system suggests a
play-list for that emotion, saving a lot of time for a user over selecting and playing
songs manually. Emotion-Based Music Player also keeps track of user’s details like
number of plays for each song, sorts songs based on category and interest level, and
reorganizes the play-list every time. The system also notifies user about the songs
that are never played so that they can be deleted or modified
